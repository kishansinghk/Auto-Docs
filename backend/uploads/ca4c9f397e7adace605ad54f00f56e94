                <p class="p-5">Indulge in the royal flavors of our Handi Chicken Biryani, a traditional favorite that combines fragrant basmati rice, succulent marinated chicken, and aromatic spices. Slowly cooked in a sealed "handi" (clay pot), the chicken absorbs all the rich flavors of cinnamon, cardamom, saffron, and a hint of cumin, creating a dish that is bursting with taste. Each grain of rice is perfectly separated, infused with a beautiful blend of herbs and spices, and the chicken is tender and juicy. </p>
